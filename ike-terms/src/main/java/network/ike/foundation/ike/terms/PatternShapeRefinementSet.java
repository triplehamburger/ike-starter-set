/**
 * Mints the meaning/purpose concepts the corrected pattern shapes in
 * {@code foundation.TinkarRootConceptPart2} reference: the SOLOR/Tinkar-inherited baseline collapsed
 * meaning and purpose into one concept for many patterns — a real modeling weakness KEC
 * flagged reviewing the rendered pattern-shape table (IKE-Network/ike-issues#880):
 * meaning names what kind of thing this is, purpose names why it is captured. Under the
 * inception flatten (IKE-Network/ike-issues#894) each corrected shape is the pattern's
 * <em>single</em> declared version, written in place at its section declaration; this
 * file contributes only the fresh concepts those shapes cite by derived identity
 * ({@code conceptRef} resolves the derivation, so section order is immaterial).
 * <p>
 * Two economies keep the concept count down without sacrificing rigor: (1) patterns
 * sharing an identical structural shape (five chronicle-shape patterns, five
 * version-shape patterns, two navigation patterns) share ONE purpose concept for that
 * shape, rather than minting a near-duplicate per pattern; (2) several shapes reuse
 * concepts this starter set <em>already has</em> — {@code Author}/{@code Module}/
 * {@code Path} as meaning (mirroring how {@code StatusValue} already correctly differs
 * from {@code StatusForVersion}), and {@code AuthorForVersion}/{@code ModuleForVersion}/
 * {@code PathForVersion}/{@code TimeForVersion}/{@code StatusForVersion} as purpose —
 * both families were already present, just never paired against a distinct meaning.
 * The IKE-Network/ike-issues#891 Model-Feature pointer fixes (a pattern's
 * referenced-component meaning must differ from every field meaning) contribute the
 * Originated Module/Path, Branch, Identified Component, and Axiom concepts.
