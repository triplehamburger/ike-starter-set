/**
 * Mints the view-coordinate-model family (IKE-Network/ike-issues#950, settled KEC
 * 2026-07-25). The baseline piled every coordinate dimension flat under
 * {@code ImmutableCoordinate Properties} while three per-coordinate families
 * (Language/Logic/Path coordinate properties) sat apart under {@code Object properties},
 * and the navigation dimensions had no family at all — their would-be home was fused
 * into the {@code NavigationCoordinate/Directed graph} entry {@code foundation.DirectedGraph}
 * repairs. This file contributes the missing roots: {@code View coordinate model} plus
 * the {@code Stamp}/{@code Edit}/{@code Navigation coordinate properties} families. The
 * pre-existing families and every dimension concept are re-parented in place at their
 * section declarations (registered in {@code DELIBERATELY_REPARENTED_ISA}).
 * <p>
 * <b>Partonomy, stated logically (settled: machinery and definitional use).</b> The true
 * relation between a properties family and the model is composition, not kind-of alone —
 * a navigation coordinate is <em>part of</em> the view coordinate model. Each family
 * root therefore carries, alongside its is-a placement, an existential
 * {@code Part of} restriction on {@code View coordinate model}; each dimension concept
 * carries one on its family root. {@code Part of} is seated as a transitive role type at
 * its own declaration ({@code foundation.Meaning}), so the reasoner derives dimension
 * ∘ family → model. EL++ has no inverse roles, so part→whole is the one canonical
 * direction — {@code has-part} is never minted. Textual and logical definitions are kept
 * consistent: each definition below says what the concept is (the is-a) and what it is
 * part of (the role), in the same breath the axioms state.
