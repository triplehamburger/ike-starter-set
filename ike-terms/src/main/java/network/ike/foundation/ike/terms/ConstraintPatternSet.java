/**
 * The field constraint apparatus (IKE-Network/ike-issues#890, refining the #880
 * original): a KB-native way to constrain a pattern field's legal values, with the
 * rules authored as plain semantic data. The organizing rule is that <b>the pattern
 * axis is the parameter shape</b> — one constraint pattern per parameter tuple, never
 * one per datatype, and never a union-by-sentinel (a kind or relation field
 * discriminates within a shape only when every field stays meaningful for every kind).
 * Two shapes exist today:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Taxonomy Field Constraint Pattern</b> — (Constrained field, Constraint
 *       kind, Constraint anchor concept). Intensional: the legal set is derived from
 *       the taxonomy under the checking view, the kind selecting the
 *       {@code NavigationCalculator} walk. The four kinds — kind-of, descendant,
 *       leaf-descendant, immediate-child — share this identical tuple, so one pattern
 *       carries them all with the kind as a genuine parameter.</li>
 *   <li><b>Value-set Field Constraint Pattern</b> — (Constrained field, Value-set
 *       pattern, Value-set field, Member match relation). Extensional and
 *       datatype-universal: the member type is declared by the source pattern's named
 *       Model Feature, so this one shape yields closed enumerations of any field
 *       datatype. How a value must match a member is a concept from the closed Member
 *       match relation taxonomy below; evaluation dispatch stays code-sovereign via
 *       the {@code MemberMatchEvaluator} service seam whose {@code ConstraintTerm}
 *       bindings restate these identities in code (IKE-Network/ike-issues#889),
 *       admission gated by the bijection test in {@code FoundationFidelityIT}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A constraint semantic attaches to the <b>pattern being constrained</b> (its
 * referencedComponent) and is first-class content of that pattern: no module, no
 * exclusion, declared descriptive identities, retrieval by enumeration, and
 * conjunctive composition — each semantic is one conjunct, and all must hold. Every
 * field of every constraint semantic is meaningful — no Blank Concept sentinel
 * anywhere in this story.
 * <p>
 * Fresh IKE-local identity throughout: the closest existing concepts,
 * {@code TinkarTerm.CONCEPT_CONSTRAINTS} and {@code TinkarTerm.ASSEMBLAGE_FOR_CONSTRAINT},
 * are dead SOLOR stubs with zero live references anywhere and no documented semantics
 * of their own, so — unlike {@link NarrativeContentSet}'s reuse of rich-surface's
 * Prose element pattern — there is no established meaning to confidently adopt here.
 * Reading and enforcing these constraints (e.g. in Komet's field editors) is
 * explicitly out of scope: this file mints the representation, the worked examples,
 * the apparatus's own bootstrap self-constraints, and the apparatus koncepts' curated
 * narratives for the guide's Field Constraints chapter (IKE-Network/ike-issues#888),
 * which complement the Constrained Pattern hub narrative in
 * {@link NarrativeContentSet}.

                        k:TaxonomyFieldConstraintPattern[] is the intensional constraint shape: a
                        semantic of it stores a rule, never a list. The legal set for the
                        k:ConstrainedField[] is derived from the knowledge graph under the checking
                        view's navigation coordinate — walked from the k:ConstraintAnchorConcept[] by
                        whichever of k:TaxonomyFieldConstraintKind[]'s four children the
                        k:ConstraintKind[] field names. The four kinds are four editorial intents about
                        a taxonomy region: k:KindOfFieldConstraint[] says the anchor is itself a legal
                        value, alongside everything beneath it; k:DescendantFieldConstraint[] says the
                        anchor is a header — legal values sit strictly beneath it;
                        k:LeafDescendantFieldConstraint[] says only the concrete leaves qualify, never
                        the grouping concepts that exist to organize them; and
                        k:ImmediateChildFieldConstraint[] says the taxonomy is a closed one-level value
                        list — exactly how the STAMP pattern's status field holds to the immediate
                        children of k:StatusValue[].

                        Because the legal set is derived rather than copied, governing it moves to
                        whoever governs that taxonomy region: minting a new kind of k:Author[] extends
                        what every author-constrained field accepts, with no constraint edit anywhere.
                        And because the derivation runs under a view, the legal set is view-relative —
                        two checking views can answer differently — so checking is an authoring-time
                        and QA-time calculator operation, never a property a stored value carries with
                        it.""");
