/**
 * Mints the graph-structure family (IKE-Network/ike-issues#950): the baseline carried a
 * single fused entry — {@code Directed graph (SOLOR)} with the regular name
 * {@code NavigationCoordinate/Directed graph} — conflating a coordinate-model notion
 * with a mathematical structure, and left the structure family without its kinds. This
 * file contributes the missing kinds; the fused entry's repair is written in place at
 * its section declaration ({@code foundation.DirectedGraph}), which re-parents
 * {@code Directed graph} under the {@code Graph} minted here (registered in
 * {@code DELIBERATELY_REPARENTED_ISA}) and drops the coordinate half of the name. The
 * coordinate half becomes {@code Navigation coordinate properties} in
 * {@link CoordinateModelSet}.
 * <p>
 * The family is pure kind-of: {@code Graph} → {@code Tree}, {@code Graph} →
 * {@code Directed graph} (DiGraph), and {@code Directed tree} (DiTree) under
 * <em>both</em> {@code Directed graph} and {@code Tree} — the multi-parent placement is
 * the point, and is also why {@code EL++ digraph} stays a digraph: a classified
 * subsumption structure is a DAG precisely because concepts like DiTree have more than
 * one parent. {@code EL++ ditree}, minted here, names the axiom <em>form</em> — each
 * stated or inferred logical expression is one rooted directed tree — as distinct from
 * {@code EL++ digraph}, the classification <em>result</em> over a full axiom set
 * (settled: KEC 2026-07-25, IKE-Network/ike-issues#950).
 * <p>
 * Deliberately NOT placed here: {@code DiTree data type} / {@code DiGraph data type}
 * (Display Fields) and {@code DiTree default} / {@code DiGraph default} (defaults
 * apparatus). A field data type or a default-value provision is not a kind of tree or
 * graph — it is a model concept <em>about</em> values with that structure — so those
 * concepts keep their own families and their textual definitions name the structure
 * concept they carry instead of claiming kinship (no cross-hierarchy is-a; settled Q2:
 * placement is logically definitional, and textual and logical definitions must be
 * consistent and work together).
