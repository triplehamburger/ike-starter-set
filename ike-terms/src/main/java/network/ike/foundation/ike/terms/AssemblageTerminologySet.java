/**
 * The modern membership-pattern terminology (IKE-Network/ike-issues#880): KEC's rule —
 * treat "assemblage" the same way this project already treats the other rejected
 * philosophical/OWL-baggage term for describing IKE's own work. Pattern is the modern
 * equivalent Tinkar itself settled on: a pattern's own semantics — the components
 * carrying that pattern's public id — already are the set "assemblage" used to name.
 * <p>
 * Under the inception flatten (IKE-Network/ike-issues#894) the four SOLOR-inherited
 * concepts that carried "assemblage" in their fully qualified names are corrected in
 * place at their section declarations ({@code foundation.ImmutableCoordinateProperties}/{@code LanguageCoordinateProperties}/
 * {@code DescriptionType}, registered in {@code DELIBERATELY_RENAMED_FQNS}), and the three
 * already-correctly-modeled membership patterns ({@code Tinkar base model component
 * pattern}, {@code Komet base model component pattern}, {@code Version control path
 * pattern}) carry {@code Set membership (IkeFoundation)} as the purpose of their single
 * declared version in {@code foundation.TinkarRootConceptPart2}. This file mints that purpose concept
 * and the fresh IKE-native {@code Solor Concepts Pattern (IkeFoundation)}.
 * <p>
 * {@code SOLORConceptAssemblage} (the pattern) is left untouched entirely — it is
 * dormant (zero live semantics anywhere in the ingested foundation, confirmed before this
 * file was written) — and is cited in the narrative only as legacy prior art, the same
 * treatment already given {@code TinkarTerm.CONCEPT_CONSTRAINTS} when
 * {@code ConstraintPatternSet} was minted. {@code Solor Concepts Pattern (IkeFoundation)}
 * is the fresh IKE-native replacement going forward. {@code Membership semantic (SOLOR)}
 * itself stays real and unrenamed — just no longer this project's own preferred
 * terminology.
