/**
 * Declares the shared prose-element apparatus at its foundation home
 * (IKE-Network/ike-issues#937): the "Prose element pattern (RichSurfaceTerms)" this
 * set's own narrative content attaches its prose semantics to
 * ({@link NarrativeContentSet}, {@link DefaultsAndTemplatesSet},
 * {@link DataTypeDefaultsSet}), and the three role concepts the pattern's declaration
 * references — its meaning (Prose element), its purpose and field purpose (Element
 * content), and its field meaning (Prose content). Before this section existed the
 * pattern was cited by a bare {@code EntityProxy} handle and never declared, so the
 * standalone artifact shipped dangling references — caught by the export accounting
 * (IKE-Network/ike-issues#933) and ruled by the closure principle this section
 * satisfies: every reference resolves within the set's own declarations; shared terms
 * are declared in ike-terms, and referencing sets reuse them, never the reverse.
 * <p>
 * The identities are adopted, not minted: each is the established RichSurfaceTerms
 * derivation {@code T5(eaa95241-1a1b-4c48-8266-4be1fe9124b0, birth FQN)} — the same
 * identities {@code rich-surface-starter-knowledge} declares — so the two sets converge
 * component-for-component when merged into one store, and the descriptions authored
 * here land on the same component-anchored semantic identities as rich-surface's own
 * (versions of one description, not duplicates). The (RichSurfaceTerms) birth tag is
 * kept: the tag records the set of birth, and adoption preserves identity, name
 * included.
