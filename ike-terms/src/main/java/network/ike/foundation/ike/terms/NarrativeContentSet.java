/**
 * Curated, long-form AsciiDoc manuscript content, attached to this set's own hub
 * koncepts (IKE-Network/ike-issues#879) — the KB-native alternative to hand-typed
 * prose living only in {@code ike-guide.adoc}. Not part of the ingested foundation
 * (the auto-generated, regeneration-locked {@code foundation.Section*} classes): this
 * is genuinely new curatorial content, so it lives in its own "IKE carriers"-style
 * section, wired from {@link IkeSource} alongside {@link ConceptSet}.
 * <p>
 * Each semantic is of the shared "Prose element pattern (RichSurfaceTerms)" — a
 * single-{@code String}-field pattern for "an embedded prose block ... with id-bearing
 * k: tokens as the interchange form," one ecosystem-wide convention for prose with k:
 * tokens rather than a near-duplicate per set. Since IKE-Network/ike-issues#937 the
 * pattern is <em>declared</em> in this set ({@link ProseElementSet}, adopted
 * RichSurfaceTerms identities): the earlier bare-{@code PublicId} reference left the
 * standalone artifact with dangling references, and the referential-closure principle
 * requires every reference to resolve within the set's own declarations — shared terms
 * are declared in ike-terms, and referencing sets reuse them.
 * <p>
 * Content here is real AsciiDoc source (paragraphs soft-wrapped across source lines,
 * a blank line between paragraphs, {@code k:} chip references inline) — the
 * {@code koncept-narrative} block macro splices it into the guide via
 * {@code Processor.parseContent}, so it is re-parsed as real AsciiDoc, not frozen as
 * raw text: embedded {@code k:} chips resolve exactly as they do in the guide's own
 * hand-typed prose.

                        Every human-readable name in the knowledge base is a description: a
                        k:DescriptionPattern[] semantic attached to a concept, carrying the description's own
                        language, its text, its case significance, and which of three description types it
                        is — k:FullyQualifiedNameDescriptionType[] (the one formal, unique name every concept
                        must have), k:RegularNameDescriptionType[] (a synonym), or
                        k:DefinitionDescriptionType[] (the natural-language definition text this guide renders
                        for every koncept).

                        A description's acceptability within a dialect is a separate semantic layered on top
                        of it: k:USDialectPattern[] and k:GBDialectPattern[] each record whether a description
                        is k:Preferred[] or merely k:Acceptable[] for that dialect, so the same concept can
                        carry a British spelling and an American one side by side, each preferred in its own
                        dialect. Language itself is a concept too — k:EnglishLanguage[] and its siblings —
                        not a string constant.

                        A `LanguageCoordinate` picks one description out of all of a concept's candidates by
                        walking four preference lists, each itself modeled as a koncept:
                        k:LanguageNidForLanguageCoordinate[] (which language to prefer),
                        k:DescriptionTypePreferenceListForLanguageCoordinate[] (fully qualified name before
                        regular name, or the reverse), k:DialectPatternPreferenceListForLanguageCoordinate[]
                        (US before GB, or the reverse), and k:ModulePreferenceListForLanguageCoordinate[] (a
                        final tie-break when two descriptions are otherwise equally preferred). The calculator
                        matches language first, then walks description-type order, then prefers a dialect
                        acceptability of k:Preferred[] matching the dialect preference order, then breaks any
                        remaining tie by module preference.

                        As a pattern, k:DescriptionPattern[] itself carries a referenced-component meaning of
                        k:DescriptionSemantic[] — "purpose and meaning for the description pattern and dialect
                        patterns," in its own words, though a later revision (IKE-Network/ike-issues#880) gives
                        it a distinct purpose too: k:DescriptionAttachment[], naming why the pattern exists —
                        to attach a human-readable name or definition to a concept. Four fields each carry
                        their own meaning and purpose concept: k:LanguageConceptNidForDescription[] (meaning)
                        for k:Language[] (purpose), k:TextForDescription[] (meaning) for k:Description[]
                        (purpose), k:DescriptionCaseSignificance[] (meaning) for k:CaseSensitivityRule[]
                        (purpose — whether the text is case-sensitive), and k:DescriptionType[] (meaning) for
                        k:DescriptionRole[] (purpose — which of the three description roles this one plays).

                        The two dialect patterns named above share one shape, differing only in which
                        national dialect each is attached to: k:USDialectPattern[] and k:GBDialectPattern[]
                        each carry a referenced-component meaning of k:DescriptionAcceptability[] and a
                        purpose of k:DescriptionSemantic[], with one field — its meaning
                        k:UnitedStatesOfAmericaEnglishDialect[] for the US pattern,
                        k:GreatBritainEnglishDialect[] for the GB one, its purpose
                        k:DescriptionAcceptability[] in both — the field a description's

                                        + " Fields)")), """
                        Some of the concept-typed field kinds above — k:AuthorField[], k:ModuleField[],
                        k:StatusField[], and others — are conventionally restricted to a known, bounded set
                        of legal values: only concepts kind-of k:Author[] make sense as a STAMP's author
                        field, only the immediate children of k:StatusValue[] as its status. Nothing in the
                        field-definition model above expresses that restriction — a field's declared data
                        type says it holds *a* concept, never *which* concepts, and the same holds for
                        every other data type.

                        Two constraint patterns close that gap, one per parameter shape — the pattern axis
                        is the parameter shape, never the datatype, and never a union carried by sentinel
                        values. Both attach to the pattern being constrained, and both share a
                        referenced-component meaning of k:ConstrainedPattern[] — the attachment target's
                        role: the pattern that has one of its own fields constrained, identical for both
                        shapes — and a purpose of k:FieldValueRestriction[]. A pattern's constraint
                        semantics compose conjunctively: each semantic is one conjunct, and a value is legal
                        only when every conjunct on its field holds.

                        k:TaxonomyFieldConstraintPattern[] is the intensional shape: the legal set is
                        derived from the taxonomy under the checking view. Its three fields each carry
                        their own meaning and purpose concept: k:ConstrainedField[] (meaning) for
                        k:ConstraintScope[] (purpose — which field this rule governs); k:ConstraintKind[]
                        for k:ConstraintRule[] (which rule applies); and k:ConstraintAnchorConcept[] for
                        k:TaxonomyReferencePoint[] (the concept the rule measures against).
                        k:ConstraintKind[]'s legal values are k:TaxonomyFieldConstraintKind[]'s four
                        children — k:KindOfFieldConstraint[] (the anchor plus every descendant, self
                        included), k:DescendantFieldConstraint[] (descendants only),
                        k:LeafDescendantFieldConstraint[] (leaf descendants only — excluding grouping
                        concepts that exist solely to organize others), and
                        k:ImmediateChildFieldConstraint[] (direct children only) — an identical tuple for
                        all four, which is exactly why they are kinds within one pattern rather than four
                        patterns. Concretely, this starter set's own STAMP pattern carries four such
                        semantics: constrained field = k:Author[], kind = k:KindOfFieldConstraint[],
                        anchor = k:Author[] — the same concept identifies both the field and the anchor
                        here, since a later revision (IKE-Network/ike-issues#880) gave the Author field
                        itself k:Author[] as its own meaning — likewise Module and Path, and a fourth
                        whose tuple reads constrained field = k:StatusValue[], kind =
                        k:ImmediateChildFieldConstraint[], anchor = k:StatusValue[] again: a concept can
                        serve as both a field's own meaning and a constraint's own anchor without
                        conflict, since the two roles are read from different fields entirely.

                        k:ValueSetFieldConstraintPattern[] is the extensional shape, and it is
                        datatype-universal: the members are enumerated as data, and the member type is
                        whatever the source pattern's named Model Feature declares, so this one shape
                        yields closed enumerations of any field datatype. Its four fields:
                        k:ConstrainedField[] for k:ConstraintScope[] again; k:ValueSetPattern[] (meaning)
                        for k:LegalValueSource[] (purpose — the pattern whose active semantics enumerate
                        the legal values); k:ValueSetField[] for k:ValueDisambiguation[] — naming the
                        Model Feature that holds the member value by its meaning concept, either a
                        declared field's meaning or the source pattern's referenced-component meaning
                        (membership patterns supported, no sentinel); and k:MemberMatchRelation[] for
                        k:MatchRule[] (purpose — how a value must match a member). The constraint is
                        satisfied when some member active under the checking view matches the value under
                        the named relation — membership itself carries the ordinary STAMP lifecycle, so
                        adding a member is authoring and removing one is retiring. This starter set's own
                        illustrative k:StarterSetAuthorRosterPattern[] shows why the Model-Feature pointer
                        is needed: each roster entry is a semantic with *two* fields, k:RosterAuthor[] and
                        k:RosterOrder[], and only the first is the value a member is matched against. The
                        worked constraint on k:PreferredReviewerPattern[] reads: constrained field =
                        k:PreferredReviewer[], value-set pattern = k:StarterSetAuthorRosterPattern[],
                        value-set field = k:RosterAuthor[], relation = k:EqualMatchRelation[].

                        How a value must match an enumerated member is itself a concept, never invented
                        syntax: k:MemberMatchRelation[] is a closed taxonomy whose relations are directed
                        and named in full. Evaluation dispatch stays code-sovereign — each relation's
                        evaluator declares its relation concept's identity in code, so code points at
                        knowledge and knowledge never carries an operative pointer at code: imported
                        content can never redirect what constraint checking executes. Admission is a
                        bijection, enforced by test: relation concepts correspond one-to-one with the
                        shipped evaluators, so minting a relation without shipping its evaluator fails,
                        and shipping an evaluator without minting its relation fails.
                        k:EqualMatchRelation[] is the sole admitted relation today: equality by the member
                        datatype's natural equality — entity references by identity, scalars by value,
                        byte arrays by content, Decimal by numeric equality, and Float by IEEE
                        comparison, so NaN matches nothing, keeping the loud-defaults coherence (an
                        unrevised NaN default fails its constraint until revised); graph types await the
                        isomorphic relations.

                        The apparatus constrains itself, as ordinary content: a
                        k:TaxonomyFieldConstraintPattern[] semantic on each constraint pattern holds its
                        own discriminator field to its closed taxonomy — k:ConstraintKind[]
                        immediate-child of k:TaxonomyFieldConstraintKind[], and the
                        k:MemberMatchRelation[] field immediate-child of k:MemberMatchRelation[].

                        Why mint fresh identity, rather than adopting k:ConceptConstraints[] — a real, if
                        long-dormant, SOLOR concept whose own definition, "defined filters for a given
                        concept," reads almost as if it were written for this exact mechanism? Because it
                        carries no live semantics anywhere in this ecosystem to confirm what "defined
                        filters" actually meant — no field shape, no worked example, no consuming code — and
                        adopting an identity on the strength of a plausible-sounding one-line gloss risks
                        importing an unintended meaning later, if that dormant concept's real intent turns
                        out to differ from what is built here. k:ConceptConstraints[] remains exactly where
                        it was — cited here as legacy prior art rather than resumed identity, a distinction
                        worth drawing plainly, since the rest of this starter set leans hard the other way
                        (adopting existing identity, as with k:AuthorForVersion[] and every other
                        SOLOR-sourced concept named in this guide) whenever a real, checkable definition
                        backs the reuse rather than merely a plausible-sounding name.

                        No pattern-model change was needed to represent any of this: every taxonomy
                        constraint kind composes directly from graph-walk operations a navigation
                        calculator already provides — k:KindOfFieldConstraint[] from `kindOf`,
                        k:DescendantFieldConstraint[] from `descendentsOf`,
                        k:ImmediateChildFieldConstraint[] from `childrenOf`, and
                        k:LeafDescendantFieldConstraint[] by filtering `descendentsOf` down to the nodes
                        `childrenOf` finds empty. Reading and *enforcing* these constraints — in Komet's own
                        field editors, for instance, which today have no such notion at all — is a
                        deliberately separate, later concern from representing them; what the representation
                        already makes possible today is exactly the candidate set a reader would want to
                        see, computed fresh every render, with no separate authoring step — the live listing
                        just below is every concept a k:KindOfFieldConstraint[] anchored at k:Author[] would
                        accept, walked from the same k:Author[] broader relationship the constraint's own
                        definition points at.""");

                        """
                        k:ModelConcept[] anchors every concept in this guide that describes the knowledge
                        base's own structure rather than a domain it represents — the model-versus-data
                        distinction k:DataConcept[] draws on the other side (k:DefaultDataConcept[] and its
                        siblings group actual data values, not structural terminology). k:TinkarModelConcept[]
                        is the root of Tinkar's own meta-schema specifically: components, descriptions,
                        dialects, fields, and axioms — every chapter in this guide, from k:DescriptionPattern[]
                        to k:Axioms[] to k:FieldCategories[], ultimately descends from this one concept.

                        A component's persisted form is a *chronicle*: k:ChronicleProperties[] names what
                        every chronicle carries regardless of component kind — k:PrimordialUUIDForChronicle[]
                        (its own birth identity), k:SemanticListForChronicle[] (every semantic attached to
                        it), k:VersionListForChronicle[] (its own version history). k:ComponentChronologyPattern[]
                        and k:ComponentVersionPattern[] name the generic shape every chronicle/version pair
                        takes; k:ConceptFieldPattern[]/k:ConceptVersionPattern[],
                        k:PatternChronologyPattern[]/k:PatternVersionPattern[],
                        k:SemanticChronologyPattern[]/k:SemanticVersionFieldPattern[], and
                        k:STAMPChronologyPattern[]/k:STAMPVersionFieldPattern[] specialize that shape for
                        each of the four component kinds this guide has already named.
                        k:TinkarBaseModelComponentPattern[] and k:KometBaseModelComponentPattern[] are
                        membership patterns, not shape descriptions — both carrying a referenced-component
                        meaning of k:StarterDataAuthoring[] and purpose of k:SetMembership[], with no fields
                        of their own: a semantic of one of these patterns marks a component as belonging to
                        Tinkar's own base terminology or Komet's own — the same membership-pattern convention
                        k:SolorConceptsPattern[] uses (discussed in the Logic Coordinates chapter) to mark
                        a component as part of the SOLOR concept space.

                        Each chronicle-shape pattern's own referenced component and fields make that
                        specialization concrete. k:ComponentChronologyPattern[] — the base shape — carries a
                        referenced-component meaning of k:ComponentField[] and a purpose of
                        k:ChronicleIdentityAndHistory[] — one shared concept naming why every chronicle-shape
                        pattern exists: to record a component's own identity alongside its complete version
                        history — and two fields, each with its own meaning and purpose concept:
                        k:PublicIDField[] (meaning) for k:UniquelyIdentifyKnowledgeGraphComponents[] (purpose),
                        and k:ComponentVersionsField[] (meaning) for k:ComponentVersionsSet[] (purpose) — every
                        chronicle's own identity plus its version list. k:ConceptFieldPattern[] and
                        k:PatternChronologyPattern[] specialize that same two-field shape for concepts and
                        patterns respectively (referenced-component meaning k:ConceptField[] or
                        k:PatternField[] in turn, the same shared purpose, fields
                        k:PublicIDField[]/k:ConceptVersionsField[] or
                        k:PublicIDField[]/k:PatternVersionsField[]). k:SemanticChronologyPattern[] carries two
                        fields more than its siblings — a semantic's own chronicle must also record which
                        pattern it is a semantic *of* and what it is *attached to* — a referenced-component
                        meaning of k:SemanticField[] and the same shared purpose, and four fields:
                        k:PublicIDField[]/k:UniquelyIdentifyKnowledgeGraphComponents[],
                        k:SemanticPatternField[] (meaning) for k:PatternMembership[] (purpose — which pattern
                        this semantic is an instance of), k:SemanticReferencedComponentField[] (meaning) for
                        k:AttachmentTarget[] (purpose — what this semantic is attached to), and
                        k:SemanticVersionsSet[] (meaning) for k:VersionHistory[] (purpose).
                        k:STAMPChronologyPattern[] rounds out the family — meaning k:STAMPField[], the same
                        shared purpose again, fields k:PublicIDField[]/k:UniquelyIdentifyKnowledgeGraphComponents[]
                        and k:STAMPVersionsField[]/k:STAMPVersionsSet[].

                        The version side mirrors this, with its own shared purpose concept:
                        k:ComponentVersionPattern[] and k:ConceptVersionPattern[] each carry a
                        referenced-component meaning of k:ComponentVersionsField[] or k:ConceptVersionsField[]
                        respectively, and a purpose of k:VersionSnapshot[] — why every version-shape pattern
                        exists: to record one point-in-time state of a chronicle. Each has a single field,
                        k:STAMPField[] (meaning) for k:VersionProvenance[] (purpose) — a version, at its
                        simplest, is just its own STAMP, recorded for provenance: who committed it, in what
                        state, module, path, and when. k:SemanticVersionFieldPattern[] adds a second field to
                        that base shape — meaning k:SemanticVersionsField[], the same shared purpose, fields
                        k:STAMPField[]/k:VersionProvenance[] and (already correctly distinct) meaning
                        k:SemanticFieldField[] for purpose k:SemanticFieldFieldsSet[] — a semantic's own
                        version must also carry the actual field values that version holds.
                        k:STAMPVersionFieldPattern[] is the richest of the chronicle/version family: meaning
                        k:STAMPVersionsField[], the same shared purpose, and six fields —
                        k:STAMPField[]/k:VersionProvenance[], plus k:StatusField[]/k:StatusForVersion[],
                        k:TimeField[]/k:TimeForVersion[] (data type k:StringDataType[]),
                        k:AuthorField[]/k:AuthorForVersion[], k:ModuleField[]/k:ModuleForVersion[], and
                        k:PathField[]/k:PathForVersion[] — the same k:StatusForVersion[]/k:AuthorForVersion[]/
                        k:ModuleForVersion[]/k:PathForVersion[]/k:TimeForVersion[] purpose concepts this guide's
                        own STAMP pattern (see the STAMP Concepts chapter) also uses; the base-model layer
                        specializes those five fields into a single, more directly authored five-field pattern.
                        k:PatternVersionPattern[] is richer still: meaning k:PatternVersionsField[], the same
                        shared purpose, and four fields — k:STAMPField[]/k:VersionProvenance[],
                        k:PatternMeaningField[] (meaning) for k:MeaningDeclaration[] (purpose),
                        k:PatternPurposeField[] (meaning) for k:PurposeDeclaration[] (purpose), and
                        k:FieldDefinitionField[] (purpose k:FieldDefinitionsSet[], data type
                        k:ComponentIdSetDataType[]) — literally the shape behind every pattern declaration in
                        this starter set's own source: the meaning, purpose, and field-definition list every
                        pattern this guide names is itself an instance of.

                        A semantic's own properties are named separately from its host chronicle's:
                        k:SemanticProperties[] groups k:ComponentForSemantic[] (which pattern it is of),
                        k:ReferencedComponentNidForSemantic[] (what it is attached to), k:LogicGraphForSemantic[]

                        field — this starter set's own constraint apparatus deliberately carries no such
                        sentinel: one constraint pattern per parameter shape means every field of every
                        constraint semantic is meaningful — while k:SandboxComponent[] and k:UninitializedComponent[] mark a

                        base model with description-logic property characteristics inherited from SOLOR: a
                        reflexive property relates every concept to itself; a transitive property, if it
                        relates A to B and B to C, also relates A to C — mathematical characteristics a

                        with its single field also using k:Comment[] as both its own meaning and purpose —
                        four slots, one concept, conflating "what the field holds" (a comment) with "what
                        role the referenced component plays" (the subject that commentary is about). A
                        later revision splits these apart: the pattern's referenced-component meaning is now
                        k:SubjectOfCommentary[] — the referenced component's role, distinct from the
                        commentary's own content type — and its purpose is k:EditorialClarification[] — why
                        the commentary exists: to explain an authoring decision or provide context a formal
                        field can't capture. The field itself keeps k:Comment[] as its meaning (that part was
                        always correct — the field genuinely does hold a comment) but now carries
                        k:EditorialClarification[] as its purpose too, the same concept reused at both
                        levels; its data type, k:StringDataType[], is unchanged. Tinkar's own
                        `PatternVersion` model supports this cleanly: the original SOLOR-sourced version
                        stays in history untouched, and a `StampCoordinate` positioned after the revision
                        simply resolves the newer one. Two more small patterns round out this starter set's
                        own editorial
                        metadata: k:StarterSetAuthorRosterPattern[] (this guide's own illustrative value-set
                        example, introduced in the Semantic Field Model chapter) carries a referenced-component
                        meaning of k:StarterSetAuthorRoster[] and a purpose of k:RosterMembership[] — why the
                        pattern exists, to enumerate this starter set's own author roster as a value-set
                        source — and two fields: k:RosterAuthor[] (meaning) for k:RosterEntry[] (purpose) and
                        k:RosterOrder[] (meaning) for k:DisplaySequence[] (purpose, data type k:Long[]) — the
                        sort-order field that makes it a genuine two-field worked example for value-set field
                        disambiguation. k:PreferredReviewerPattern[] carries a referenced-component meaning of
                        k:PreferredReviewerAssignment[] and a purpose of k:ReviewRouting[] — why the pattern
                        exists, to direct a component's future edits to a specific reviewer — and one field,
                        k:PreferredReviewer[] (meaning) for k:AssignedReviewer[] (purpose) — which author is
                        the preferred reviewer for a given component's future edits.

                        k:CorrelationProperties[] groups a different kind of metadata: characteristics
                        describing the relationship *between* two or more variables, rather than an
                        annotation on one component alone. k:CorrelationExpression[] and
                        k:CorrelationReferenceExpression[] name the value and the reference value a
