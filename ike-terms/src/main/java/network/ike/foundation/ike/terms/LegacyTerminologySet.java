/**
 * Mints the top-level {@code Legacy} branch — a visible deprecation signal for
 * dormant/superseded content (IKE-Network/ike-issues#880 follow-up). Content filed here
 * stays live and resolvable, just flagged in the taxonomy as a near-future removal
 * candidate rather than left silently mixed in among current terminology.
 * <p>
 * First occupant: {@code Dynamic column data types (SOLOR)} ({@code DynamicColumnDataTypes}
 * and its 9 children — Boolean/Decimal/Float/Double/Long/Array/ByteArray/SignedInteger/
 * UUIDDataType). Investigation found it is <em>not</em> dead: {@code komet}'s
 * {@code PatternFieldsController} (kview) walks its descendants to populate a pattern-authoring
 * "choose a data type" list — but that list is disconnected from {@code ConceptToDataType}'s
 * own recognized set (the family a pattern's real field declarations actually use), so
 * picking from it would produce a field whose declared dataType throws
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if ever resolved. Under the inception flatten
 * (IKE-Network/ike-issues#894) the reparent is written in place at the concept's section
 * declaration ({@code foundation.Meaning}, registered in
 * {@code DELIBERATELY_REPARENTED_ISA}); this file contributes only the branch concept,
 * which that declaration cites by derived identity.
 * <p>
 * {@code Legacy} sits under {@code Model concept} (KEC ruling 2026-07-26,
 * IKE-Network/ike-issues#952, superseding the original root-level placement): the
 * content being flagged at this time is legacy <em>model</em> concepts, and the branch
 * may be eliminated entirely before the inception release. Domain content never files
 * here — domain concepts follow their own per-source contracts (retirement in place,
 * as SNOMED practices), so a domain branch handles deprecation its source's way.
