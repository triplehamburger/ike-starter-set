/**
 * The defaults-and-templates apparatus (IKE-Network/ike-issues#885): defaults and
 * templates are ordinary working-path content — complete semantics of the target
 * pattern — kept out of domain reads by two structural dimensions of the model itself,
 * not by any defaults-specific machinery. The <b>referenced component names the
 * category</b>: a default value semantic of a pattern attaches to {@code Default value
 * concept}; a template semantic of a pattern for a given purpose attaches to that
 * purpose's own child of {@code Template concept}. The <b>module is the category
 * boundary and the import/export packaging</b>: every version of a defaults or template
 * chronology lives in the {@code Defaults and templates module}, and that module holds
 * only such content — the bidirectional live-and-die invariant
 * {@code FoundationFidelityIT} enforces. Consumers scope affirmatively (member set
 * crossed with pattern); the attachment concepts never join domain member sets, so a
 * support declaration can never read as a domain assertion.
 * <p>
 * <b>Identity is computed, never queried</b>: a default value semantic's PublicId is
 * the stock {@link UuidT5Generator#singleSemanticUuid(dev.ikm.tinkar.common.id.PublicId,
 * dev.ikm.tinkar.common.id.PublicId) singleSemanticUuid(patternPublicId,
 * attachmentConceptPublicId)} — a consumer resolves "the default for this pattern" by
 * computing the UUID, and the derivation doubles as the uniqueness key: a second default
 * chronology for the same (pattern, attachment concept) pair cannot be minted without an
 * identity collision. Per-user preferences are per-path versions of this same
 * computed-identity chronology; migration between sandboxes is an identity-keyed
 * copy-forward.
 * <p>
 * Module boundary within this file: the three apparatus concepts minted here — the two
 * attachment points and the module concept itself — are foundation terminology
 * <em>about</em> defaults and templates, not defaults themselves, so they stamp in the
 * foundation module ({@link Ike#MODULE}); only instance content (the worked-example
 * default value semantic) stamps in the new module.
 * <p>
 * Deliberately out of scope here: StampCalculator accessors and the version-iteration
 * exclusion ({@code getDefault}/{@code getTemplate} — tinkar-core,
 * IKE-Network/ike-issues#886), and the seeded GB-dialect semantic's disposition
 * (IKE-Network/ike-issues#887). The sixteen-type exemplar this apparatus was designed
 * for lives in {@link DataTypeDefaultsSet}, composed immediately after this file.
