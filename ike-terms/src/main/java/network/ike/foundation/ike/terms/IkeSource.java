/**
 * The IkeFoundation ledger's composition entry: build tooling discovers this source,
 * composes the sections, and replays the session.
 * <p>
 * The whole pre-release set is authored at the one declared inception time,
 * the platform's named inception instant ({@code PrimitiveData.INCEPTION_EPOCH},
 * rendered as the word "Inception"), under exactly two stamps — the foundation-module
 * inception stamp and its Defaults-and-templates-module counterpart
 * (IKE-Network/ike-issues#894). No chronology carries more than one version, so
 * composition order below is constrained only by the declaration-before-reference rule
 * for declared-identity components; derived-identity references ({@code conceptRef})
 * are order-free.
