 * absolute paths, so a consumer of the index can only reach files beneath a root it has itself
 * resolved — which means an index copied from another machine, or edited by hand, still cannot
 * name a file outside the project.
 *
 * <p>The identifier is a stable, machine-independent name for the directory, in practice a Maven
 * module's artifact identifier. It is what allows the same index to be read from a different
 * checkout path than the one that produced it.
 *
 * @param id        the stable identifier for this root
