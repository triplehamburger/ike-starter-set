/**
 * Writes a file in one step, so a reader never sees a partial one.
 *
 * <p>This matters more than it might seem. The files these goals write are the author's own source
 * — a draft chapter, the guide itself — usually open in an editor at the time. A plain write
 * truncates the file and then fills it, and anything that interrupts the process in between leaves
 * the author's work as a half-written file. Writing to a temporary file in the same directory and
 * moving it into place makes the change all-or-nothing: either the old content or the new,
 * never a mixture.
 *
 * <p>The temporary file is created in the destination directory rather than the system temporary
 * directory because an atomic move is only atomic within a filesystem.
