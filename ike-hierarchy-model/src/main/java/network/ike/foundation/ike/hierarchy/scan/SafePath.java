/**
 * The containment check every path in this system passes through before it is read or written.
 *
 * <p>The rule is one sentence: a path is usable only if, after symbolic links are resolved, it
 * still lies beneath a declared scan root. There is no fallback. The processor this design
 * replaces resolved an unrecognised include target against the filesystem root and read whatever
 * it found, which made {@code include::chapter:../../../../etc/passwd[]} a working directive in a
 * documentation build. Nothing here resolves a path it was not given a root for.
 *
 * <p>This bounds accident, not attack. Chapter files are trusted input, on par with build scripts:
 * the documentation render runs under {@code SafeMode.UNSAFE}, which
 * {@code asciidoctor-maven-plugin} hardcodes with no parameter to override, so a chapter file can
 * read any file the build user can read with one ordinary {@code include::} that never comes near
 * this class. What the checks here are for is the mistake — a symbolic link out of the tree, a
 * stale index naming a file that has moved, a path assembled from a root it does not belong to.
 *
 * <p>Resolution is done with {@link Path#toRealPath} rather than {@link Path#normalize} because
 * normalising is a string operation: it collapses {@code a/../b} without ever asking the
 * filesystem, so it cannot see that {@code a} is a symbolic link pointing somewhere else
 * entirely. Only a real-path resolution closes that gap.
