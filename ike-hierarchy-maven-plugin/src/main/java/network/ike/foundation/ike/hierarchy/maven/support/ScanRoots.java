/**
 * Turns the goals' configured root directories into resolved, contained scan roots.
 *
 * <p>Every configured root must resolve beneath the reactor root. That single rule is what bounds
 * the whole system: a chapter can live anywhere in the project, and nowhere outside it. A build
 * that configures a root pointing elsewhere — by accident, by a stale absolute path in someone's
 * settings, or through a symbolic link — is refused rather than quietly reading files from outside
 * the repository into the published guide.
 *
 * <p>The default is a single root at the reactor root itself, which is what makes "drop a file
 * anywhere in the project" literally true: no directory is privileged, and adding a module does
 * not require telling this plugin about it.
